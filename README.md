Abstract:This project presents a smart, real-time safety monitoring system for Ola S1 electric scooters, focusing on the prediction of battery burn risk using machine learning techniques. The system utilizes simulated sensor data—including battery temperature, voltage, current, and charge cycles—to represent real-world operational behavior. A Random Forest classifier is trained on this data to classify the battery condition as either safe or high risk.
The trained model is deployed through a Flask-based REST API, which processes user input and returns predictions dynamically. A user-friendly interface is developed using Streamlit, allowing users to input current battery parameters and instantly receive safety status feedback. If the model detects potential burn risk, a warning is displayed; otherwise, a safe status is confirmed.
With accurate predictions and real-time interaction, this project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be integrated with web technologies to enhance rider safety and reliability in electric vehicles. The system not only supports preventive maintenance but also builds trust in smart electric mobility.
